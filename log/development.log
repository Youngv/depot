Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 bring hundreds of improvements, including new APIs and substantial performance enhancements. The fourth edition of this award-winning classic has been reorganized and refocused so itâ€™s more useful than ever before for developers new to Ruby and Rails.\r\n\r\nRails 3 is a major releaseâ€”the changes arenâ€™t just incremental, but structural. So we decided to follow suit. This book isnâ€™t just a mild reworking of the previous edition to make it run with the new Rails. Instead, itâ€™s a complete refactoring.\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll still find the Depot example at the front, but youâ€™ll also find testing knitted right in. Gone are the long reference chaptersâ€”thatâ€™s what the web does best.
