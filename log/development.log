Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 bring hundreds of improvements, including new APIs and substantial performance enhancements. The fourth edition of this award-winning classic has been reorganized and refocused so it’s more useful than ever before for developers new to Ruby and Rails.\r\n\r\nRails 3 is a major release—the changes aren’t just incremental, but structural. So we decided to follow suit. This book isn’t just a mild reworking of the previous edition to make it run with the new Rails. Instead, it’s a complete refactoring.\r\n\r\nYou’ll still find the Depot example at the front, but you’ll also find testing knitted right in. Gone are the long reference chapters—that’s what the web does best. Instead you’ll find more targeted information on all the aspects of Rails that you’ll need to be a successful Web developer.", "image_url"=>"/images/rails4.jpg", "price"=>"43.95"}, "commit"=>"Update Product", "id"=>"1"}

It enforces good design principles, consistency of code across your team (and across your organization), and proper release management.But Rails is more than a set of best practices. Rails makes it both fun and easy to turn out very cool web applications. Need Ajax support, so your web applications are highly interactive? Rails has it built in. Want an application that sends and receives e-mail? Built in. Supports internationalization and localization? Built in. Do you need applications with a REST-based interface (so they can interact with other RESTful applications with almost no effort on your part)? All built-in.\r\n\r\nWith this book, you’ll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. Need to create and modify your schema? Migrations make it painless (and they’re versioned, so you can roll changes backward and forward). You’ll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There is extensive coverage of testing, and the rewritten Deployment chapter now covers Phusion Passenger.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous editions of the book, we start with an extended tutorial that builds parts of an online store. And, of course, the application has been rewritten to show the best of Rails V2.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nSam Ruby is a prominent software developer who has made significant contributions to the many of the Apache Software Foundation’s open source projects, and to the standardization of web feeds via his involvement with the Atom web feed standard and the popular Feed Validator web service. He currently holds a Senior Technical Staff Member position in the Emerging Technologies Group of IBM. He resides in Raleigh, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nAs one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, Dave Thomas understands agility. As the author of “Programming Ruby”, he understands Ruby and how to describe Ruby applications.\r\n\r\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson is the creator of the Rails framework.", "image_url"=>"/images/rails4.jpg", "price"=>""}, "commit"=>"Create Product"}

It enforces good design principles, consistency of code across your team (and across your organization), and proper release management.But Rails is more than a set of best practices. Rails makes it both fun and easy to turn out very cool web applications. Need Ajax support, so your web applications are highly interactive? Rails has it built in. Want an application that sends and receives e-mail? Built in. Supports internationalization and localization? Built in. Do you need applications with a REST-based interface (so they can interact with other RESTful applications with almost no effort on your part)? All built-in.\r\n\r\nWith this book, you’ll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. Need to create and modify your schema? Migrations make it painless (and they’re versioned, so you can roll changes backward and forward). You’ll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There is extensive coverage of testing, and the rewritten Deployment chapter now covers Phusion Passenger.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous editions of the book, we start with an extended tutorial that builds parts of an online store. And, of course, the application has been rewritten to show the best of Rails V2.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nSam Ruby is a prominent software developer who has made significant contributions to the many of the Apache Software Foundation’s open source projects, and to the standardization of web feeds via his involvement with the Atom web feed standard and the popular Feed Validator web service. He currently holds a Senior Technical Staff Member position in the Emerging Technologies Group of IBM. He resides in Raleigh, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nAs one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, Dave Thomas understands agility. As the author of “Programming Ruby”, he understands Ruby and how to describe Ruby applications.\r\n\r\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson is the creator of the Rails framework.", "image_url"=>"rails4.jpg", "price"=>"43.95"}, "commit"=>"Update Product", "id"=>"2"}
